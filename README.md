| **force-di** | Core library, contains **Injector** Apex API and **<c:di_injector>** VF and Lightning Components <br/>**Note:** this contains an auto-launched flow called `HelloWorld` required for the unit tests to pass. If you do not want this flow to be deployed to your org, remove it before deploying; however, unit test coverage will suffer |

The "samples" of how to use the framework can be found in the [Force-DI Samples](https://github.com/apex-enterprise-patterns/force-di-samples) project.

| Folder | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **force-app-1** | Sample application using the API and Components to inject Apex, VF and Lightning at runtime |
| **force-app-2** | Sample package providing impls for various bindings above |
| **force-app-3** | Sample package providing impls for various bindings above |
| **force-di-trigger-demo** | Sample basic trigger framework leveraging the API |
